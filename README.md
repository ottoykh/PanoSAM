## PanoSAM: Unsupervised Segmentation Using the Meta Segment Anything Model for Point Cloud Data from Panoramic Images

![PanoSAM Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ottoykh/PanoSAM/refs/heads/main/PanoSAM.jpg)
This is a prototype package designed as a proof of concept for the SAM model on panoramic image segmentation for close-range captured point clouds, such as those obtained from terrestrial laser scanners. This package facilitates users in performing unsupervised segmentation in a faster and more effective way.
